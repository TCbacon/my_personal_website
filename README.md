# Personal Website
My personal website source code. I have replaced most of the text with lorem ipsum.

## Run Program:
<ol>
<li>change directories into client folder</li>
<li>npm install</li>
<li>npm start</li>
</ol>

## Stock API KEY
An API key may be needed to retrieve stock data.
In the src folder you can rename .env.temp.local to .env.local and enter your own API key. You can get an API key at https://www.alphavantage.co/.
